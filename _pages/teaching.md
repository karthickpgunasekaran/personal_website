# Research Experience

## 1. Information Extraction & Synthesis Laboratory (I.E.S.L)
**UMass Amherst** <br>
September 2020 - February 2021 <br>
Implemented unsupervised approaches to meta-learning in order to improve few-shot generalization of NLP. Evaluated multiple pre-trained models for few-shot generalization to new tasks and new domains.

## 2. Information Extraction & Synthesis Laboratory (I.E.S.L)
**UMass Amherst & Chan Zuckerberg Initiative** <br>
January 2020 - May 2020 <br>
Developed a BERT-based architecture and used BioSentVec embedding for Biomedical Question Answering with CZI. The model saves significant amounts of time for medical practitioners searching patient records and drug interactions.

## 3. Veterinary & Animal Sciences Department (VASCI)
**UMass Amherst** <br>
May 2019 - December 2019 <br>
Used machine learning for prediction and annotation of DNA sequences crucial for genes. The research project was funded by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).


## 4. The Laboratory for Mobile Sensing and Ubiquitous Computing (MOSAIC), 
**UMass Amherst** <br>
May 2019 - August 2019 <br>
Developed a novel model with Prof. Tauhidur based on multispectral physiological parameter estimation. Researched the effect of external factors such as angle, blur, lighting, and sweat on the estimation project. Worked on a novel LSTM architecture for the estimation of Galvanic skin response with multispectral imaging.
