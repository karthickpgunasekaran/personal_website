I currently work as an Applied Scientist for Amazon. My work within AWS is dedicated to
advancing the productivity of Sellers, and I adopt a multidisciplinary approach that
intersects deep learning, causal inference, and econometrics. Causal
inference enables me to investigate the cause-and-effect relationships between different
factors affecting Seller performance. This multidisciplinary approach allows me to
uncover meaningful relationships and provide actionable recommendations that drive
success for Sellers on the platform.

# Background

Prior to Amazon, I pursued my graduate research at UMass Amherst under the guidance
of Prof. Andrew McCallum. My research interests revolve around various aspects of
machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The primary objective of my
research is to enhance machine learning models by enabling them to generalize in a
manner similar to humans. This involves focusing on aspects such as efficiency in data
and computing, leveraging unsupervised learning signals, and incorporating external
knowledge. Lately, my attention has been dedicated to enhancing the generalization
capabilities of NLP models when confronted with limited human-labeled data. I achieve
this through approaches like meta-learning, self-supervised learning, and multi-task
learning. I had the privilege of conducting extensive research in the field of machine
learning-based gene annotation techniques, under the invaluable guidance of Prof.
Cynthia Baldwin and Janice Telfer. Throughout this endeavor, my focus was primarily on
two key methodologies: hidden Markov models (HMMs) and support vector-based
techniques. During my research, I delved into the intricacies of hidden Markov models,
exploring their applications and fine-tuning them to address gene annotation challenges.
Additionally, I extensively studied support vector-based techniques, harnessing their
potential for gene annotation tasks.
